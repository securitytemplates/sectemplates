# Overview
Use this document during a retrospective meeting on a particular incident, or request stakeholders to fill this out async. The goal of this exercise is not to assign blame, it's to 
* Identify ineffeciencies to ensure a smoother process moving forward.
* Identify things that went well which can verify if processes/systems are working correctly
* Verify stakeholder satisfication with how the incident was handled, as well as understanding its root cause
