# Safe Harbor Policy

## What is safe harbor?
A “safe harbor” is a provision that offers protection from liability in certain situations, usually when certain conditions are met. In the context of security research and vulnerability disclosure, it is a statement from an organization that hackers engaged in Good Faith Security Research and ethical disclosure are authorized to conduct such activity and will not be subject to legal action from that organization.

 ## Why do you need safe harbor?

There are instances where companies have taken legal actions against security researchers when they have reported vulnerabilities. Having a safe harbor policy in place assures researchers about your intent to work with them in good faith.

Bug bounty platforms will bring this up in your initial conversations as well.

## Sample Safe Harbor

When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider this research to be:

* Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (and/or similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
* Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
* Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis for work done under this policy; and
Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.
* You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws.
* If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please inquire via support@bugcrowd.com before going any further.
