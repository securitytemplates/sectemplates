# Introduction to the Bug Bounty Program Pack
The goal of this release is to provide you with everything you need to establish a bug bounty program. This includes alignment with stakeholders, working with a vendor, establishing a private bug bounty, and ultimately moving to a public bug bounty. This release pack is not sponsored or influenced by any particular bug bounty vendor and is neutral to vendor biases and influence.

# Bug Bounty Frequently Asked Questions

<b>Question:</b> Do you recommend using a particular bug bounty provider?<br>
<b>Answer: </b> No, the goal of this pack is to be vendor-neutral and not lean towards one provider over another. Before selecting a vendor, you should perform a bake-off to determine which vendor works best for your situation. 
<br><br>

<b>Question:</b> Why do you recommend starting with a private bug bounty instead of going public?<br>
<b>Answer: </b> The main reason is to test your internal processes for handling externally reported issues, verify that your budget can support a wider-scoped program, and ensure the experience for the researchers is positive. Increase the scope based on your best judgment and ensure your company is prepared for handling a possible influx of issues a public program may bring.
