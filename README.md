# sectemplates 

I'd like to announce the creation of sectemplates.com, a website where infosec professionals, and startup engineering teams lacking a security team, can find templates to help bootstrap their programs. The primary focus of this site will be to provide starting points for

- Runbooks
- Programs and their associated processes
- Useful security metrics

Templates are free to use for personal and commercial use, with the exception of including them in a product that's for sale.
